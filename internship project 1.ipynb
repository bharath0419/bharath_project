We start by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset from the  StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. The data is then explored and visualized to understand distributions and relationships. Preprocessing steps include dropping rows with missing values and encoding categorical variables. The data is split into training and testing sets, and a linear regression model is trained on the training data. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error and RÂ² Score. Finally, we demonstrate how to make predictions for new data points."],"metadata":{"id":"vvwWbKCAlguV"}}]}
